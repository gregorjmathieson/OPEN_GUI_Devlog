                    <li>Objects are now loaded correctly from files. Whenever parameters are changed, and then the project saved, the objects can be loaded with the same parameters. In other words, the objects can be saved and loaded from files correctly.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a small problem where the object list was just displaying "Asset" for all asset types. Now it shows the correct asset type. Note that this information is taken from the asset type class declaration in the System directory, so in theory should work for any new type of asset that is added.</li>
                    <li>The New Asset button now works again, and the data can be saved when the whole project is saved.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Bug when displaying the "Asset" type object. Seems to be a problem with numpy arrays... <code>TypeError: iteration over a 0-d array</code></li>
                    <li>The New Asset Dialogue still needs to be completed.</li>
                    <li>There should be a way of deleting an asset (with an "Are you sure?" dialogue) by right-clicking the active asset list.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Should have an option to import objects from other projects / user directory somewhere.</li>
                    <li>Probably need to redo entire sphinx documentation process as too much has changed in the project.</li>
                    <li>Definitely need to make the gui refresh after a new project is loaded.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Completed the load project dialogue. This dialogue can be accessed via <code>Data -> Load -> Load Project</code>.</li>
                    <li>The load project dialogue is also opened on start-up, since functionality of the GUI will now depend on there being an active project selected.</li>
                    <li>There is a small issue with forward and back slashes, where python strings cannot contain a backslash, but the os active dirtectory is written with backslashes. This does not impede any functionality so will be ignored for now, but it looks ugly.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Added the ability to switch between projects. The active project is always displayed at the status bar.</li>
                    <li>Assets are now loaded from the /ENERGY_SYSTEM/ASSETS/ folder whenever a project is loaded.</li>
                    <li>Added a class method for clearing all active assets.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Need to add a method of the canvas refreshed whenever a new project is loaded.</li>
                    <li>Need to change the New Asset dialogue to include a way of selecting all parameters etc before saving the new asset to a .open file.</li>
                    <li>Small bug where the user directory search bar is now empty, rather than showing the active directory.</li>
                    <li>The import of curves.py had to be commented out for the GUI to function properly, will have to rewrite the curves display next year.</li>

                    <li>Project data can now be saved into the active project directory.</li>
                    <li>Currently there is only the option to save the entire project, which saves all of the assets and the market objects as <code>.open</code> files.</li>
                    <li>There should be a dialogue that opens on start up that forces the user to select an active project to start (unless there isn't one).</li>
                    <li>Note that there will be a "sample project" that will come with the OPENGUI install for demonstration purposes.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Added a dialogue box to load a project to be the "active project" <code>Data -> Load -> Load Project</code>.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Changed the way arrays are displayed in the wx.propertygrid in the Object Parameters panel. Object Parameter arrays can now be edited more easily, and the function that updates the changed values has been updated as well.</li>
                    <li>System for better data permanance is to be implemented using data serialization.</li>
                    <li>Proposed new file system to save user data in shown below. The user should be able to click <code>File -> New -> Project</code> and a new project should be created within "UserData" with the following directory tree:</li>
                    <a href="IMAGES/17-11-22/ProposedFileTree.PNG" data-lightbox="17-11-22"><img class="images" src="IMAGES/17-11-22/ProposedFileTree.PNG" height="100px"></a>
                    <br>
                    <li>A new file type <code>.open</code> can be used using python's pickle module. This module can serialise data and store it in files that can then be read at a later date.</li>
                    <li>The idea is for <code>.open</code> files to contain instantiated object information that can be loaded at a later date. This type of serialisation should lead to the ability to import projects to different machines etc., as well as more data permanance within the OPENGUI.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Implementation started for saving files, a new function <code>saveObject()</code> was built in the <code>SaveData.py</code> module. This function should allow for selected instantiated objects to be saved to the UserData section.</li>
                    <li>New Projects can be created by pressing <code>File -> New -> Project</code>. The active project is then displayed on the status bar at the bottom of the canvas.</li>
                    <li>User should have the choice to save the entire project at any given time through <code>Data -> Save -> Project Data</code>. The user should also be asked about overwriting data, closing without saving, etc through pop-up windows.</li>

                    <li>Energy system tree now expanded by default.</li>
                    <li>Active objects panel now has bold column headers, as well as a fixed width for columns. This makes the active object list more readable.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Changed gui name to OPEN_GUI rather than OPEN_CANVAS</li>
                    <li>Changed main file from CurrentMainCanvas.py to OPENGUI_main.py</li>
                    <li>Added a generic confirmation pop-up dialogue.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Files are now loaded into the data grid by double clicking on a file in the user library. The data page in the notebook in the central panel is automatically selected.</li>
                    <li>Added an <code>on_close()</code> function to be called when the window is closed to assure the program is killed.</li>

                    <li>A more generic simulation method should be developed to allow for more freedom.</li>
                    <li>The network portion of the energy system currently has very little interaction, other than changing some values on the three active buses already a part of the current simulation. In the future more network manipulation should be added.</li>

                    <li>This test case utilises the existing OPEN_buildings_case_study.py file, however the file has been copied and renamed to "building_test.py" for my own testing purposes. Note also that the internal code in the original test script has been defined inside of a __main__() function for the sake of passing variables from the GUI.</li>
                    <li>Currently, as a simple test, the "building_test.py" file can be run by pressing "Run" -> "Run Simulation" -> "OPEN Test"</li>

                    <li>This choice is then passed onto the "building_test.py" script and the entire script is executed. Note that it would be simple to add more parameters in the event dialogue to change inside of the test file.</li>

                    <li>Obviously more functinality and communication between the OPEN library and OPENGUI will be added in the future, but this is a great first step in terms of functionality</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>There are now four main tabs in a notebook in the central area of the canvas. The "Active Asset Attributes" panel at the top right of the canvas has also been updated to be a "Property Grid", which should allow for better displaying of the attributes of a selected asset once that function is in place.</li>
                    <li>Also, the "Active Asset List" panel at the bottom right of the canvas is now a wxListCtrl, which is essentially just a list of text that allows for event handling when each item is selected. This is the obvious next step in the development process.</li>
                    <li>Note also in the images below that the "Add Row" and "Add Column" buttons do not function as of yet.</li>
                    <li>A notable new feature that has been developed is the ability to save data to a .csv filetype, and open this file in excell. A potential flaw here is my choice to not record any empty spaces between values. Since the data is small enough to be almost negliginle, I may decide to just record every item in the grid, regardless if it has value null or not.</li>
                    <li>The writeToCSV() function is stored in an external .py file.</li>
                    <li>Note that currently there is no user input to change the filename. It will just be "data", however the number next to data will increment if a file with that name already exists: data1, data2, etc...</li>

                    <li>As of yet there is no ability to load data, although the tast should be relatively straightforward to implement. The reason I have not implemented this feature as of yet is due to the possibility of there being more data than can fit on the active grid within the canvas. I am not sure how the GUI would react and would like to do some testing.</li>
                    <li>In the future, I would like to implement a library of asset types than can be accessed by the main file. This will allow for different strings to be shown in the "Active Asset Attributes" tab that will change dynamically depending on the class of asset chosen.</li>
                    <li>I am not sure how to proceed with the curves section. wxWidgets requires the support of third party libraries to display graphs within the GUI so I will need to do some research. It should be easy enough, however to display some charts and graphs in external popup windows, the way OPEN already does.</li>
                    <li>I have made a small list of naming conventions that I have been using for variables and functions so far... I will keep this updated as I continue and maybe cross-check this with colleagues to ensure it is comprehensible.</li>

                    <li>I managed to get a data table showing on the central window of the canvas.</li>
                    <li>Using the wxGrid library, I created a simple data table, and added a notebook tab at the top. The notebook tabs will make it possible to switch between data tables.</li>
                    <li>At this point in time, I am not sure if other data display windows will also be included within these notebook tabs.</li>

                    <li>Today I ended up solving the main functional problem I was facing yesterday. Now, whenever you select a folder using the browse button in the directory selector bar, an event handler causes the folder to be opened in the directory tree below it.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li>By using a simple event handler, whenever the directory selected in the bar above is changed, the active folder in the directory is also changed. Here I used the GetPath() and SetPath() functions that are part of the DirCtrlPicker class in the wxWidgets library.</li>
                    <li>In the example photos, I selected a folder called "oop practice", which can then be seen as selected in the directory below.</li>
                    <li>The visual issues discussed yesterday are still issues, however now the functionality that I wanted is in place, so I can move on to another part of the canvas.</li>
                    <li>Tomorrow I will attempt to show some sort of spreadsheet or data table in the central portion of the canvas.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Happy New Year! I have taken an extended hiatus from work on this project due to exams at the end of last semester, as well as the holiday season. Sorry for lack of progress and updates.</li>
                    <li>To start off, I have found a rather simple solution to the file directory panel on the canvas not showing the current working directory. Python has a basic os library that has a getcwd() command that provides the current working directory of wherever the python file is located.</li>
                    <li>The current directory tab looks completely fine, although currently has a lack of any real functionality. That will likely be my next step since I have a clear vision of what I would like to do with it. Hopefully one should be able to type in any directory into the search bar and it should appear on the dropdown list shown.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li>Something I am not happy with right now is the fact that the visual directory shows your entire computer's file tree. It is a bit ugly and since the search bar should have this function I would like to get rid of it, but it is also a minor problem so I might leave it on the backburner for now.</li>
                    <li>Another minor problem is that currently there is no method of changing the size of the window. I think this is definitely something I would like to have working in the future.</li>
                    <li>A larger overarching problem I can see myself running into at this point of the development process is the fact that everything is still running from one file. Since I have a clearer vision of what I am working on now I think one of my next steps should be to study up on how to clean up my code and introduce modularity through script files and data files of some sort.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Found a visual implementation tool for wxWidgets (the parent library of wxPython), called <a href="https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder">wxFormBuilder</a>. It seems to be a really useful and intuitive tool, and it is sure to speed up the development process a considerable amount.</li>
                    <li>Just because I am using a visual implementation tool now doesn't mean that all of the time I spent learning the wxPython coding library is in vain however, since the tool seems to be limited. Some of the more advanced features will have to be coded in manually.</li>
                    <li>The wxFormBuilder also doesn't seem to have very good documentation. It is essentially just taken from the <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/page_class_cat.html">wxWidgets library</a> though, so this might not be that big of a problem.</li>
                    <li>Below, a simple mock-up with buttons (right) based off of the planned canvas layout (left) (Click to enlarge):</li>

                    <li>Canvas seems to look okay in the window when the program runs. I am worried, however, about screen resolutions. I am developing this on a high resolution monitor, and although there are methods in wxPython to get the native resolution, namely wx.GetDisplaySize(), it only takes the display size of the monitor that the program initlialises to... I will have to look into this problem further.</li>
                    <li>I tried creating seperate panels in the main frame of the GUI window. For my own aid, I coloured each region so I could tell where each panel was. (Click to enlarge)</li>

                    <li>I found sizing to be a big issue. As stated before, depending on the size of the monitor, the size of the panel changes. This is something that is going to take some time to fix.</li>

                            <li>Presentation slides didn't support my spoken presentation very well. Images and visualisation is is good, but it is important that the information on the slides play an active role in presenting the information.</li>
                            <li>I wasn't super clear on what OPEN is; I will need to have a more detailed description of OPEN and its significance.</li>
                            <li>The displayed mock-up wasn't very good. I had the canvas shown, but it wasn't in very good detail, I will have to have a more in-detail mock-up of the GUI canvas.</li>

                            <li>Power information. Power diagrams and bus network displays should be visually appealing and easy to understand at a glance. Use of colour is recommended.</li>
                            <li>Curves and graphs. Maybe have a MatPlotLib extension.</li>
                            <li>Data. This should be in tabular format, and should be filterable.</li>
                            <li>Also, it should be stated that the user should be able to upload their own datasets, their own asset library, and their own control algorithms.</li>

It also seems to be common to have a large central SPICE-esque canvas to place the grid entities. Colour is often used to have an intuitive first-glance read on the situation of the simulation. Another common theme is to keep different tabs for graphs and other information in smaller windows within the program. Examples are shown below: (Click to enlarge)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Set about making a short-term list of goals to achieve with my understanding of the new GUI system (I keep track of these goals <a href="https://trello.com/b/vg6ECrdb/beng-todo">here</a>). These should act as building blocks when I start putting the GUI together:
                        <ol>
                            <li>be able to create a new entity, and edit that entity's attributes</li>
                            <li>be able to display graphs after simulation</li>
                            <li>be able to drag and drop entities</li>
                            <li>be able to make connections</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>I followed some <a href="https://realpython.com/python-gui-with-wxpython/">basic tutorials</a> on how to get a basic windows application up and running, starting with a simple program that prints to the console any number typed into a textbox before pressing a button to confirm your input:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Noticed that the "drag and drop" visual GUI implementation tool for Python with Visual Studio 2019 is no longer supported</li>
                    <li>Explored some methods for still using the "drag and drop" method by using C# or Visual Basic and running it in tandem with python code, but it seems dofficult to do and probably quite slow.</li>
                    <li>Decided to use <a href="https://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, a Python GUI development toolkit. WxPython uses native widget elements and is cross-platform, so it shouldn't look strange if it's run on MAC or LINUX distribututions. It also has ample documentation online so seems ideal for a first-time development.</li>
                    <li>To brush up on some OOP in Python, I watched and followed along with Corey Schafer's tutorial playlist, very detailed and informative.</li>
