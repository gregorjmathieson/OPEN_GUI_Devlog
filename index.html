                    <li>Eventually it will have the functionality of changing the main display to the button selected, i.e. show curves or the data table etc.</li>

                    <li>Today I ended up solving the main functional problem I was facing yesterday. Now, whenever you select a folder using the browse button in the directory selector bar, an event handler causes the folder to be opened in the directory tree below it.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li>By using a simple event handler, whenever the directory selected in the bar above is changed, the active folder in the directory is also changed. Here I used the GetPath() and SetPath() functions that are part of the DirCtrlPicker class in the wxWidgets library.</li>
                    <li>In the example photos, I selected a folder called "oop practice", which can then be seen as selected in the directory below.</li>
                    <li>The visual issues discussed yesterday are still issues, however now the functionality that I wanted is in place, so I can move on to another part of the canvas.</li>
                    <li>Tomorrow I will attempt to show some sort of spreadsheet or data table in the central portion of the canvas.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Happy New Year! I have taken an extended hiatus from work on this project due to exams at the end of last semester, as well as the holiday season. Sorry for lack of progress and updates.</li>
                    <li>To start off, I have found a rather simple solution to the file directory panel on the canvas not showing the current working directory. Python has a basic os library that has a getcwd() command that provides the current working directory of wherever the python file is located.</li>
                    <li>The current directory tab looks completely fine, although currently has a lack of any real functionality. That will likely be my next step since I have a clear vision of what I would like to do with it. Hopefully one should be able to type in any directory into the search bar and it should appear on the dropdown list shown.</li>
                    <div id="album">

                    </div>
                    <li>Something I am not happy with right now is the fact that the visual directory shows your entire computer's file tree. It is a bit ugly and since the search bar should have this function I would like to get rid of it, but it is also a minor problem so I might leave it on the backburner for now.</li>
                    <li>Another minor problem is that currently there is no method of changing the size of the window. I think this is definitely something I would like to have working in the future.</li>
                    <li>A larger overarching problem I can see myself running into at this point of the development process is the fact that everything is still running from one file. Since I have a clearer vision of what I am working on now I think one of my next steps should be to study up on how to clean up my code and introduce modularity through script files and data files of some sort.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Found a visual implementation tool for wxWidgets (the parent library of wxPython), called <a href="https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder">wxFormBuilder</a>. It seems to be a really useful and intuitive tool, and it is sure to speed up the development process a considerable amount.</li>
                    <li>Just because I am using a visual implementation tool now doesn't mean that all of the time I spent learning the wxPython coding library is in vain however, since the tool seems to be limited. Some of the more advanced features will have to be coded in manually.</li>
                    <li>The wxFormBuilder also doesn't seem to have very good documentation. It is essentially just taken from the <a href="https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/page_class_cat.html">wxWidgets library</a> though, so this might not be that big of a problem.</li>
                    <li>Below, a simple mock-up with buttons (right) based off of the planned canvas layout (left) (Click to enlarge):</li>

                    <li>Something I am worried about at this stage is how to develop the central display window on the canvas. I will probably have to add this portion manually.</li>

                    <li>Canvas seems to look okay in the window when the program runs. I am worried, however, about screen resolutions. I am developing this on a high resolution monitor, and although there are methods in wxPython to get the native resolution, namely wx.GetDisplaySize(), it only takes the display size of the monitor that the program initlialises to... I will have to look into this problem further.</li>
                    <li>I tried creating seperate panels in the main frame of the GUI window. For my own aid, I coloured each region so I could tell where each panel was. (Click to enlarge)</li>

                    <li>I found sizing to be a big issue. As stated before, depending on the size of the monitor, the size of the panel changes. This is something that is going to take some time to fix.</li>

                            <li>Presentation slides didn't support my spoken presentation very well. Images and visualisation is is good, but it is important that the information on the slides play an active role in presenting the information.</li>
                            <li>I wasn't super clear on what OPEN is; I will need to have a more detailed description of OPEN and its significance.</li>
                            <li>The displayed mock-up wasn't very good. I had the canvas shown, but it wasn't in very good detail, I will have to have a more in-detail mock-up of the GUI canvas.</li>

                            <li>Power information. Power diagrams and bus network displays should be visually appealing and easy to understand at a glance. Use of colour is recommended.</li>
                            <li>Curves and graphs. Maybe have a MatPlotLib extension.</li>
                            <li>Data. This should be in tabular format, and should be filterable.</li>
                            <li>Also, it should be stated that the user should be able to upload their own datasets, their own asset library, and their own control algorithms.</li>

                    <li>Did some quick research on how contemporary power simulation software GUIs look. A common theme is a comprehensive toolbar at the top of the screen. It also seems to be common to have a large central SPICE-esque canvas to place the grid entities. Colour is often used to have an intuitive first-glance read on the situation of the simulation. Another common theme is to keep different tabs for graphs and other information in smaller windows within the program. Examples are shown below: (Click to enlarge)</li>

                    <li>With the other examples in mind, I have created a very basic skeleton of what the UI layout might look like. Note this is not a final product, and a more elaborate mock-up will be done soon. (Click to enlarge)</li>

                    <li>Set about making a short-term list of goals to achieve with my understanding of the new GUI system (I keep track of these goals <a href="https://trello.com/b/vg6ECrdb/beng-todo">here</a>). These should act as building blocks when I start putting the GUI together:
                        <ol>
                            <li>be able to create a new entity, and edit that entity's attributes</li>
                            <li>be able to display graphs after simulation</li>
                            <li>be able to drag and drop entities</li>
                            <li>be able to make connections</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>I followed some <a href="https://realpython.com/python-gui-with-wxpython/">basic tutorials</a> on how to get a basic windows application up and running, starting with a simple program that prints to the console any number typed into a textbox before pressing a button to confirm your input:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Noticed that the "drag and drop" visual GUI implementation tool for Python with Visual Studio 2019 is no longer supported</li>
                    <li>Explored some methods for still using the "drag and drop" method by using C# or Visual Basic and running it in tandem with python code, but it seems dofficult to do and probably quite slow.</li>
                    <li>Decided to use <a href="https://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>, a Python GUI development toolkit. WxPython uses native widget elements and is cross-platform, so it shouldn't look strange if it's run on MAC or LINUX distribututions. It also has ample documentation online so seems ideal for a first-time development.</li>
                    <li>To brush up on some OOP in Python, I watched and followed along with Corey Schafer's tutorial playlist, very detailed and informative.</li>
